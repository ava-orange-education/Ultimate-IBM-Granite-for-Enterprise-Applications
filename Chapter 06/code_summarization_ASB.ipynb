    "# Using CLDK to explain Java methods\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will use [CLDK](https://github.com/IBM/codellm-devkit/tree/main) to generate a summary explaination for a Java method. You will explore some of the benefits of using CLDK to perform quick and easy program analysis and to build an LLM-based code summarizer. By the end of this tutorial, you will have implemented such a tool and generated a summary for a Java method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, you will learn how to perform the following tasks on Java code to create LLM prompts for code summarization:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new instance of the `CLDK` class.\n",
    "2. Create an analysis object for the target Java code.\n",
    "3. Iterate over all files in the code.\n",
    "4. Iterate over all classes in a file.\n",
    "5. Initialize `treesitter` utils for the class content.\n",
    "6. Iterate over all methods in a class.\n",
    "7. Get the code body for a method.\n",
    "8. Sanitize the class for prompting the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will write several helper methods to 1) format the LLM instruction for summarizing a given target method and 2) prompt the LLM via Ollama. We will then use CLDK to go through an application and generate the summary for the target method."

It has several benefits, such as understanding code without looking at its details, documenting code for better maintenance, etc. To perform code summarization, one needs to understand the basic details of the code implementation, and use that knowledge to generate the summary using various AI-based approaches. Here, we use LLMs, specifically Granite Code 83 Instruct.
